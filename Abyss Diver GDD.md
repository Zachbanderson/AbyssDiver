# Gameplay
*Abyss Diver* is designed in a way that mimics an old arcade game with a big secret (said secret is to be discussed in the Story section). The gameplay as a whole is inspired by the "Tiger Tiger!" minigame from *Xenoblade Chronicles 2*. Like in the minigame, the player in *Abyss Diver* will descend down a shaft, avoiding obstacles, killing enemies, and collecting treasure. At the start of each level, the player will have 7 seconds to get oriented, and then the camera will start moving down the shaft. The player will encounter enemies to kill and collectables to collect. Upon reaching the bottom, the player will see a Large Treasure Chest usually guarded by an enemy. Upon collecting the large chest, the camera will start moving back upwards. Shooting will be disabled on the trip upward. Upon reaching the top of the level, the level will complete. There are 5 levels initially available to the player.

# Story
The deeper story of *Abyss Diver* is only available to those who discover it. At the bottom of level 5, there will be a secret entrance off to the side. If the player decides to enter, they will reach a hidden temple with statues of different cephalopods. An octopus, a squid, a cuttlefish, and a nautilus. At the end of this temple, they will obtain an item called the "Eye of the Inkborn." This allows the player access to secret temples hidden off to the side in levels 1-4. In these temples, the player will encounter different enemies and even bosses. The goal of these fights is to tell the story in an environmental manner. Similar to the *Dark Souls* franchise or *Hollow Knight*. The true story, told in small chunks, is that there is an ancient, Lovecraftian entity residing in a deep sea trench. This entity, the Lord of the Abyss, granted sentience to different cephalopods (which are already very intelligent) but in return, demanded complete subservience. Eventually, after clearing the temples in levels 1-4, the player will find relics that open up a secret level, level 6. Upon completing level 6, the player will fight the Lord of the Abyss in level 7.

# Boss Fights (Work in Progress)
## Lord of the Abyss
- Final boss. Encountered in Level 7.
- Appearance is based off of Cthulhu from the Lovecraft mythos.
- Boss will be encountered at the bottom of level 7, where it will wake up and attack the player. The Lord will chase the player up the shaft towards the top. The player must dodge the attacks until then.
- At the top of the shaft, the player encounters a large, sharp stalactite. The player shoots the top of the stalactite to drop it on the Lord of the Abyss, killing it.
